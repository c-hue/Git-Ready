<h2> Description </h2>
This is Project 0: Git Ready for CS2400.02 by Caitlyn Hue. The program used to display knowledge with Git and GitHub is called CollegeHousing, which calculates the likeliness of a user to receive priority housing based on their circumstances.

<h2> Software </h2>
The video is produced by an open source screencast software called OBS, version 30.0.2. In the video, I used Visual Studio Code, version 1.85.2, to run the program and use git.
